    ![CopyFiles](Resources/CopyFiles.png)

2. Enable MultiDex in *Edit -> Plugins -> Misc -> MultiDex*.

    ![EnablePlugin](Resources/EnablePlugin.png)

## If you have Gradle disabled
1. Go to _[PROJECT_FOLDER]/Build/Android/_

    a) If you already have created _custom_rules.xml_ file, simply add:
      ```xml
      <import file="custom_rules_multidex.xml" optional="true" />
      ```
    b) If you don't have created _custom_rules.xml_ file yet, copy it from [[PLUGIN_FOLDER]/Extras/custom_rules.xml](Extras/custom_rules.xml).
  
2. Add new environment variable _JAVA_OPTIONS = -Xmx2048m -Xms256m -Xss8m

    _Example for Windows:_ Control Panel -> System and Security -> System -> Advanced system settings -> Environment Variables -> Uses variables for X -> New...
   
3. You should enable _MultiDex_ plugin only if you exceeded 64k methods limit. If you have a project that doesnâ€™t need multidexing the build will fail!
